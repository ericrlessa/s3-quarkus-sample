This sample project shows 3 Rest services to put, get, and generate a pre-signed URL for an image stored in S3. In the project, there are separate test classes for each type of integration using the “REST Assured” library and test containers. Also, there is an Amazon CloudFormation template to deploy the stack to your AWS account.
